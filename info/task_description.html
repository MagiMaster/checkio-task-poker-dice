        "God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising,
        which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody],
        to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room,
        with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules,
        and who smiles all the time."
    </p>

    You're at a boardgame convention, but you've gotten yourself in a situation. You registered for two tournaments, but
    later realized they both take place at the same time. Fortunately for you, you have a robotic double on hand to
    attend one of the tournaments. Now you just have to program it so it knows how to play the game.
</p>

<p>
    The game in question involves rolling 5 poker dice. After a roll you can choose to keep some of the dice and reroll
    the others. (You can choose to "unkeep" dice between rolls.) After two rerolls, or less if you want, you must choose
    which category to place your score in. After all of the categories have been scored, you add everything up to
    determine your final score.
</p>

<p>
    Poker dice are six-sided dice labeled with various cards. For this task, all the dice are the same and are labeled
    with the 9 of spades, 10 of hearts, jack of spades, queen of hearts, king of hearts and ace of spades.
</p>

<p>
    To play the game, you are given a list of your previous rolls and a dictionary containing your current score for
    each category you've scored in. You must return a list of which dice to keep or a string containing the name of the
    category to score. If this is your third roll then you must choose a category. If you pick a category you do not
    qualify for, it is worth 0 points. You have eight hands per game. You can overwrite a score with a new roll, but
    doing so will mean you won't have enough hands to score in every category.
</p>

<p>
    Each die is stored as a string containing the rank and suit as a single character each:
    "9S", "TH", "JS", "QH", "KH" or "AS".
    The category names must match those in the tables below except for capitalization (lower them).
</p>

<p>
    The categories are:
</p>
<div>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Category
        </th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>One Pair</td>
        <td>2 (3 for a pair of aces)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Two Pair</td>
        <td>4 (5 with a pair of aces)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Three of a Kind</td>
        <td>6 (8 with 3 aces)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flush</td>
        <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Straight</td>
        <td>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Full House</td>
        <td>25 (30 with 3 aces)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Four of a Kind</td>
        <td>50 (60 with 4 aces)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Five of a Kind</td>
        <td>200 (240 with 5 aces)</td>
    </tr>
</table>
